        <h1>Were you involved with leadership in your high school band? Are you passionate about music? Do you want to give back to a program you love?</h1>
        <p>
          Then you may want to consider coming out to our recruitment events!
          As a national honorary service organization, we provide our time and service to the college and university band programs. 
          The University of Florida's band program gives students the opportunity to continue their love of music; however, this opportunity would not exist
          without the help of both Kappa Kappa Psi and our sister organization Tau Beta Sigma.
          Brothers of Kappa Kappa Psi are responsible for setting up the practice field and concert stage, filling coolers for games, 
          handing out water after pregame and Gatorade after halftime and organizing the uniform room. In addition, we also complete various service projects.

            Upon initiation, new Brothers pay a one-time initiation fee of around $130 that goes to National Headquarters to register you 
            and pay national dues for the academic year. This amount is subject to change. 
            Active members pay national dues annually and chapter dues each semester, the amount of which are determined at the beginning of each semester. 
            These payments are always relatively low and are nothing compared to other fraternities. 
            Our chapter's treasurer can give you a more accurate estimate and also help you with payment plans.

            to helping transport a Grand Piano that we donated across town to a school in need of one. We are always open to new ideas for projects!

            Unlike most traditional fraternities, Kappa Kappa Psi does not have a house to host events, and all of our official events are dry.
            We have many social events throughout the year, but alcohol is not permitted at any event sponsored or hosted by the Alpha Eta chapter.
            To protect the integrity of our fraternity, we do not permit brothers who are of the proper drinking age to consume alcohol while 
            wearing regalia or property of Kappa Kappa Psi.

            Yes, it is a fair amount of work; however, you will get out of this process what you decide to put into it.
            You will be busy and learning, but in the end, it is all very worth it. 
            You will make lifelong bonds with people that share the same interests as you. 
            We are all more than just friends at Alpha Eta: We are brothers. 
            If you are given a chance to experience this journey, you'll understand how important being a brother is to all of us,

            Tau Beta Sigma is our sister organization, and our chapters serve the University of Florida bands together. 
            While both organizations are similar, each is independent, and both have different traditions. 
            In addition, both organizations do different types of service to aid the UF bands.
