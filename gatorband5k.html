          <h1>The Third Annual Gator Band 5K And Field Day</h1>
          <p>
            Join us for the Gator Band 5K and Field Day, an annual event put on by the brothers of the Alpha Eta Chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi in order to raise money to benefit the Gator Band and the College of the Arts! Proceeds from this event will go back to accomplishing our own service projects as well as fostering musicianship in the community of Gainesville.
          </p>
          <h3>In-Person 5K</h3>
          <p>
            The in-person race will take place <strong>Sunday, April 2nd, 2023 at 8 a.m. </strong>Our start and finish line is the <strong>Gator Band Practice Field</strong>, located at 1273 Gale Lemerand Drive. After you cross the finish line, participants can celebrate by enjoying refreshments and a photo-op! There will also be a field day occurring at the Gator Band Practice Field!
          </p>
          <h3>Virtual 5K</h3>
          <p>
            If you're unable to join us in-person but still want to support the Gator Band, you can register to run virtually! After registering, run the 5K at a time and date of your choice. Tag us at <strong>@gatorband5k</strong> along your route so we can share it on social media and send you your shirt!
          </p>
          <h3>Field Day</h3>
          <p>
            We will be hosting a field day at the Gator Band Practice Field, which is a full-size NCAA football field featuring synthetic turf and a large pavilion funded largely by generous donors of the UF Gator Band Alumni Association.
          </p>
          <h3>Registration</h3>
          <p>
            Online registration is $30 for community members and $25 for students with a valid UF ID. Prices increase to $35 and $30, respectively, on the day of the event, so <strong>register now to save!</strong> The Field Day cost is included in the registration for either option of the 5K, or it can be purchased separately for $5.
