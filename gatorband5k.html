          <h1>The Second Annual Gator Band 5K</h1>
          <p>
            Join us for the Gator Band 5K, an annual event put on by the brothers of Kappa Kappa Psi in order to raise money to benefit the Gator Band and the College of the Arts! Proceeds from this event will go back to accomplishing our own service projects as well as fostering musicianship in the community of Gainesville.
          </p>
          <h3>In-Person 5K</h3>
          <p>
            The in-person race will take place <strong>Saturday, March 19 at 8 a.m. </strong>Our start and finish line is the <strong>Gator Band Practice Field</strong>, located at 1273 Gale Lemerand Drive. After you cross the finish, participants can celebrate by enjoying refreshments and a photo-op!
          </p>
