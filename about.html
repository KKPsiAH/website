        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          The Alpha Eta chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi was founded on May 25th, 1931 at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida.
          It is the 31st chapter in the nation, and the first in Florida.
          Since its inception, over 1200 dedicated band members have been initiated into the chapter, providing service and leadership to the UF band programs.
          The Alpha Eta chapter is the recipient of many national awards, with our most recent being the Chapter Leadership Award.
