        and that through fraternal participation, each member will strive for the highest.

      <h1>Fraternal Code of Conduct</h1>
      <p>
        <h2>Honor</h2>
        Brothers should conduct themselves with honor at all times. Our service to college and university bands serves as an example to others. We should take pride in these accomplishments and not let anything tarnish our honorable reputation.<br><br>
        <h2>Integrity</h2>
        The character of our brotherhood is based upon the principles of decency and sincerity. Our impeccable integrity lets others know we can always be trusted to keep our word.<br><br>
        <h2>Respect</h2>
        Respect for others is a cornerstone of Kappa Kappa Psi. Our diverse membership is an asset that cannot be taken for granted. Using this strength to our advantage requires respect for others and their points of view. In return, we earn the respect from others by treating them as equals.<br><br>
        <h2>Loyalty</h2>
        Service to band programs and the Fraternity require people who are devoted to those organizations. Working together is the key to achieving our goals. Being loyal and dependable is therefore essential to our success.
